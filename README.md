# BCG Internship Project

This repository contains the work I completed for the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Virtual Internship experience. It includes data analysis, cleaning, and exploratory insights using Jupyter Notebook to support consulting-style problem solving and data-driven decision making.

## Project Overview

This project reflects my participation in a BCG Virtual Internship, where I worked on a dataset to apply analytical thinking, prepare clean data for insights, and explore meaningful patterns that could support business recommendations.

The work simulates real-world consulting tasks, such as understanding data quality issues, performing exploratory data analysis, and deriving preliminary insights that can help inform further steps in modelling or client recommendations.

## Topics Covered

The main analytical topics included in this repository are:

- Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Handling missing values

- Fixing inconsistent data types

- Standardising and formatting data

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Summary statistics

- Distribution and pattern detection

- Correlation and relationship checks

- Preliminary Analysis Insights

- Identifying trends in the dataset

- Highlighting potential areas for deeper modelling


## How to Use

1. Open the Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_Data_Cleaning (2).ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

2. Run the cells to inspect data cleaning and exploration steps.

3. Review the outputs and charts to understand the insights generated.
