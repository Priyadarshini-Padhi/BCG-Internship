🛠️ Project Overview

This project reflects my participation in a BCG Virtual Internship, where I worked on a dataset to apply analytical thinking, prepare clean data for insights, and explore meaningful patterns that could support business recommendations.

The work simulates real-world consulting tasks, such as understanding data quality issues, performing exploratory data analysis, and deriving preliminary insights that can help inform further steps in modelling or client recommendations.

💡 Topics Covered

The main analytical topics included in this repository are:

Data Cleaning & Preparation

Handling missing values

Fixing inconsistent data types

Standardising and formatting data

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics

Distribution and pattern detection

Correlation and relationship checks

Preliminary Analysis Insights

Identifying trends in the dataset

Highlighting potential areas for deeper modelling

(Exact sections depend on what’s in the Jupyter Notebook — adapt this list if you want to include specific visuals, charts, or business questions you addressed.)

📊 How to Use

Open the Exploratory_Data_Analysis_and_Data_Cleaning (2).ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Run the cells to inspect data cleaning and exploration steps.

Review the outputs and charts to understand the insights generated.
